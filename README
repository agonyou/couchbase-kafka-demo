steps to initia demo for Kafka using a 2 bucket configuraiton and a stand alone kafka-server configuration.
1. create a couchbase docker instance, see the docker hub for couchbase for example. 
if using couchbase docker instance as a server:
	setup couchbase node with at least "data" but having more services can be beneficial
if using couchbase docker instance as a client:
   	configure the bin/run-demo docker command to point to the correct "couchbase" host 
2. to start the demo execute "sh bin/run-demo.sh
3. to clean the demo executer "sh bin/clean-demo.sh"
4. be sure to customize source or sink files for the correct couchbase URL in  lib/kafka-connect-couchbase-3.1.0/config/


once prepared and all files are configured for the test

Execute sh bin/run-demo.sh 


cleanup
when done with the test:
1. stop the kafka client
2. run the clean-demo.sh script
3. flush all buckets
